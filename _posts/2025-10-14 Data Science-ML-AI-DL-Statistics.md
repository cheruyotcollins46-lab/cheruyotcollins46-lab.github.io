## 🧩 **Data Science — The Art of Insights**

Data Science is where raw data transforms into meaningful stories.  
From cleaning messy datasets to uncovering trends, I’ve learned that **data storytelling** is as powerful as the models we build.

💡 *Key Focus Areas:*
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering
- Predictive Modeling
- Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing

📘 *Favorite Tools:*  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn), R (Tidyverse, dplyr), Power BI, and SQL.
> *“Data science isn’t just about numbers. It’s about understanding — and turning that understanding into innovation.”*
