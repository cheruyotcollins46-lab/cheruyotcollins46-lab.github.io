# 🚀 My Projects
Here are some of my data science and AI projects:

## 🧭 Exploratory Titanic Dataset EDA
**🔧 Tech Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-013243?logo=matplotlib&logoColor=white) ![Seaborn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-3799E1?logo=seaborn&logoColor=white)

**📄 Description:**  
Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic dataset** to uncover survival patterns among passengers. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual exploration using Python’s data science libraries.  

Key analyses performed:  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin` columns. Converted categorical data (like `Sex` and `Pclass`) into numeric form.  
- 📊 **Univariate Analysis:** Examined individual features such as age distribution, fare ranges, and passenger class proportions using histograms and boxplots.  
- 🔍 **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored correlations between survival and demographic variables such as gender, passenger class, and age group.  
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables like “FamilySize” and “IsAlone” to capture social dynamics on board.  
- 🎨 **Data Visualization:** Produced interactive and static plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key insights — for example, higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.  
- 📈 **Insights Derived:**  
  - Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.  
  - First-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class ones.  
  - Younger passengers had a higher likelihood of survival.  
  - Larger family size slightly reduced survival probability.

**📦 Tools Used:**  
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization.  
- Pandas for data manipulation and wrangling.  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visual analytics.  

**🧾 Outcome:**  
Developed clear visual narratives and insights explaining socio-economic survival disparities on the Titanic, demonstrating strong analytical reasoning and storytelling using data.

## 🏨 Hotel Performance Analytics Dashboard
**🔧 Tech Stack:** ![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-F2C811?logo=powerbi&logoColor=black)

**📄 Description:**  
Developed a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize **hotel performance metrics** across multiple properties. The project provides data-driven insights into **revenue performance, occupancy trends, and operational efficiency**, helping hotel managers make informed business decisions.

**💼 Project Objectives:**  
- To monitor and evaluate **key hotel KPIs** such as ADR, RevPAR, DBRN, DSRN, DURN, and realization rates.  
- To provide a **centralized dashboard** for analyzing hotel revenue streams, cancellations, and booking behavior.  
- To improve **strategic decision-making** by identifying performance patterns and anomalies across branches.  

**📊 Key Features:**  
- **Revenue & Occupancy Analysis:** Displays monthly and yearly trends for occupancy rates, total revenue, and bookings.  
- **Performance Metrics Tracking:** Calculates **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**, **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**, and **Realization Rates**.  
- **Cancellations & Customer Behavior:** Visualizes cancellation patterns and their impact on revenue using dynamic filters.  
- **Interactive Slicers:** Enables users to segment data by property, month, customer type, or booking channel.  
- **Drill-through Reports:** Allows deeper exploration into individual hotel performance for management reporting.

**📈 Metrics Covered:**  
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)  
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)  
- DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)  
- DSRN (Daily Sold Room Nights)  
- DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)  
- Cancellation Rate  
- Realization Rate  

**🧠 Insights Derived:**  
- Seasonal peaks in bookings correlated with promotional campaigns.  
- High ADR and RevPAR in city-center properties indicated strong demand elasticity.  
- Cancellations were higher among online bookings compared to direct bookings.  
- Improved realization rates after operational adjustments and better booking management.  

**🧾 Tools & Methods Used:**  
- **Power BI Desktop:** Data modeling, DAX measures, and report design.  
- **Excel:** Initial data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- **Power Query:** Data transformation and integration.  

**📂 Output:**  
A dynamic, visually compelling dashboard providing actionable insights to hotel management for revenue optimization and improved customer satisfaction.
