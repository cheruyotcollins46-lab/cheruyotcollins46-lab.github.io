**🔧 Tech Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-013243?logo=matplotlib&logoColor=white) ![Seaborn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-3799E1?logo=seaborn&logoColor=white)

**📄 Description:**  
Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic dataset** to uncover survival patterns among passengers. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual exploration using Python’s data science libraries.  

Key analyses performed:  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin` columns. Converted categorical data (like `Sex` and `Pclass`) into numeric form.  
- 📊 **Univariate Analysis:** Examined individual features such as age distribution, fare ranges, and passenger class proportions using histograms and boxplots.  
- 🔍 **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored correlations between survival and demographic variables such as gender, passenger class, and age group.  
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables like “FamilySize” and “IsAlone” to capture social dynamics on board.  
- 🎨 **Data Visualization:** Produced interactive and static plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key insights — for example, higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.  
- 📈 **Insights Derived:**  
  - Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.  
  - First-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class ones.  
  - Younger passengers had a higher likelihood of survival.  
  - Larger family size slightly reduced survival probability.

**📦 Tools Used:**  
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization.  
- Pandas for data manipulation and wrangling.  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visual analytics.  

**🧾 Outcome:**  
Developed clear visual narratives and insights explaining socio-economic survival disparities on the Titanic, demonstrating strong analytical reasoning and storytelling using data.
