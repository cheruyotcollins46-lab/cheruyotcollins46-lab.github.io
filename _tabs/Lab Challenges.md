## ðŸ§© 1. Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle Challenge)
**Problem Statement:**  
Predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

**Approach:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed missing data using Pandas.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key survival patterns.  
- Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
- Tuned model performance with cross-validation.  

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Importance of feature engineering and handling missing values.  
- Model interpretability through SHAP and feature importance plots.  
- Gained confidence in structured ML pipelines.

## ðŸ“Š 2. Hotel Performance Analytics Dashboard
**Problem Statement:**  
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize hotel booking performance, cancellations, and revenue KPIs.

**Approach:**  
- Cleaned and joined booking data from multiple sources.  
- Designed DAX measures for KPIs (ADR, RevPAR, DBRN, DSRN, DURN).  
- Created slicers and visual filters for region, channel, and customer type.  
- Published the report to Power BI Service for online sharing.  

**Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Excel, Power Query  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Practical use of DAX functions for analytical metrics.  
- Dashboard design principles for business decision-making.  
- Value of automation using scheduled Power BI refresh.

**Approach:**  
- Preprocessed image datasets and applied data augmentation.  
- Built a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using confusion matrices and ROC curves.  
- Optimized model through dropout and batch normalization.  

**Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab

**Problem Statement:**  
Assess the relationship between TVET traineesâ€™ employability and industry partnerships.

**Approach:**  
- Collected survey data from trainees, alumni, and industry representatives.  
- Conducted regression analysis to test the relationship between variables.  
- Interpreted coefficients and p-values to evaluate statistical significance.  
- Presented findings using data visualizations in SPSS and Python.  

**Tools Used:** SPSS, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Excel  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Applying regression modeling to real-world research data.  
- Interpreting statistical outputs for policy and academic recommendations.  
- Strengthened documentation and reporting skills.
